GENERAL refactoring/review
- rename MarketModelExerciseValue as ExerciseValue
- factor out market data for all tests
- use realistic data in CapletSwaptionCalibration
- review/implement CurveState tests
- setOnDiscoutnRatio in the CurveState base class
- export all evolvers to Excel
- Get LMM code in the same use format as other code via instrument classes,
  from LMM -> QL::INSTRUMENT -> EXCEL
- define equality for evolution description
- split up marktmodel.xlm, qlo\marktmodel.hpp, qlo\marktmodel.cpp
- refactor flatvol and abcdvol into genericcorrgenericvol
- swaption calibration using Z matrix with displacements
- verify efficiency of rapid algorithm for reduced factor models
- linear combination of bonds as numeraire
- relevantRates (?)

TEST
- clean up tests (common market data)
- dedicated drift test
- cotS->fwd and fwd->cotS adapters: inverse, etc
- payment date different from reset dates

Calibration
- calibrator to produce abcd form from market data, with displacements
- caplet cot_swaption calibration
