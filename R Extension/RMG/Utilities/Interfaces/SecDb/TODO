 * Seems like R NULL is not mapped to SecDb Null.  Dan, can you take a
   look? -- AAD 7/26/2012  I have a workaround by using evaluateSlang,
   but it would be nice if it worked. 

  require(SecDb)

  SecDBLib  <- "_Lib Elex Strip Addin Fns"
  SecDBFun  <- "ElecStrip::BalmoDlyPrices"
  res <- secdb.invoke(SecDBLib, SecDBFun, Sys.Date(), "NEPOOL", "CT",
    NULL, NULL, 0.0)  # the second NULL gets mapped to 0!
