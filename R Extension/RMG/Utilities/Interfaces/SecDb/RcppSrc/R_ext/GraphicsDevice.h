/* New device driver structure
 * NOTES:
 * 1. All locations and dimensions are in device coordinates.
 * 2. I found this comment in the doc for dev_Open -- looks nasty
 *    Any known instances of such a thing happening?  Should be
 *    replaced by a function to query the device for preferred gpars
 *    settings? (to be called when the device is initialised)
         *
         * NOTE that it is perfectly acceptable for this	
         * function to set generic graphics parameters too	
         * (i.e., override the generic parameter settings	
         * which GInit sets up) all at the author's own risk	
         * of course :)						
	 *
 * 3. Do we really need dev_StrWidth as well as dev_MetricInfo?
 *    I can see the difference between the two -- its just a 
 *    question of whether dev_MetricInfo should just return
 *    what dev_StrWidth would give if font metric information is
 *    not available.  I guess having both allows the developer
 *    to decide when to ask for which sort of value, and to decide
 *    what to do when font metric information is not available.
 *    And why not a dev_StrHeight?
 * 4. Should "ipr", "asp", and "cra" be in the device description?
 *    If not, then where?
 *    I guess they don't need to be if no device makes use of them.
 *    On the other hand, they would need to be replaced by a device
 *    call that R base graphics could use to get enough information
 *    to figure them out.  (e.g., some sort of dpi() function to
 *    complement the size() function.)

     * ---------------------------------------
     * Graphical parameters are now passed in a graphics context
     * structure (R_GE_gcontext*) rather than individually.
     * Each device action should extract the parameters it needs
     * and ignore the others.  Thought should be given to which 
     * parameters are relevant in each case -- the graphics engine
     * does not REQUIRE that each parameter is honoured, but if
     * a parameter is NOT honoured, it might be a good idea to
     * issue a warning when a parameter is not honoured (or at
     * the very least document which parameters are not honoured
     * in the user-level documentation for the device).  [An example
     * of a parameter that may not be honoured by many devices is
     * transparency.]
