/*
 *	Some Notes on Line Textures
 *
 *	Line textures are stored as an array of 4-bit integers within
 *	a single 32-bit word.  These integers contain the lengths of
 *	lines to be drawn with the pen alternately down and then up.
 *	The device should try to arrange that these values are measured
 *	in points if possible, although pixels is ok on most displays.
 *
 *	If newlty contains a line texture description it is decoded
 *	as follows:
 *
 *		ndash = 0;
 *		for(i=0 ; i<8 && newlty & 15 ; i++) {
 *			dashlist[ndash++] = newlty & 15;
 *			newlty = newlty>>4;
 *		}
 *		dashlist[0] = length of pen-down segment
 *		dashlist[1] = length of pen-up segment
 *		etc
 *
 *	An integer containing a zero terminates the pattern.  Hence
 *	ndash in this code fragment gives the length of the texture
 *	description.  If a description contains an odd number of
 *	elements it is replicated to create a pattern with an
 *	even number of elements.  (If this is a pain, do something
 *	different its not crucial).
