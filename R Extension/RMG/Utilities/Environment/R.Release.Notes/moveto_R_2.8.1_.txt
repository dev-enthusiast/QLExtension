# Document code breaks in R 2.8.1 vs R 2.6.1 
#

 - 2.8.1 is timezone aware.  This is great for DST issues we had
 before.  However, after loading the SecDb package, a lot of warnings
 get generated when using POSIXct, POSIXlt objects.  SOLUTION: set the
 system tz to "" after loading the SecDb package.  No adverse effects
 were found.  (e47187)
 > require(SecDb)
 > Sys.setenv(TZ="")
